SIGnet is a Special Interest Group of CompSoc, based on computer networking.

## Our Goals
* Help each other with learning about networking.
* Find out, and share new interesting things in the networking world.

#### Meetups
* Casual meetups are currently held monthly at a food place (usually [Akva](http://www.bodabar.com/akva/)) for brunch.
* We plan to hold workshops around various network technologies.

#### Online
* You can find us in [the CompSoc chat]({{ site.baseurl }}/chat), on #networking for IRC, and #signet on Discord: There is usually always someone around for a chat, and of course, always feel free to ask any questions.
* Website coming soon...

More information about Special Interest Groups can be found on [the main SIG page]({{ site.baseurl }}/special-interest-groups).
